# Data-logger-Learning
This was an early on Arduino project where I taught myself how to utilize the sd card reader, lcd screen, and pwm pins. 


I imported the data into a csv file and created a graph. My very first data generation and manipultaion. Perhaps one day looking back on this will be like looking back on my childhood photos. 

You can check out the video I took to show Professor Emerson.
